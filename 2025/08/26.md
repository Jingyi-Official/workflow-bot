<summary>ðŸ“„ Paper Summary </summary>

### 1. Task / Problem
- Inventory Optimization with Real Data

### 2. Motivation & Gaps
- The paper addresses the challenge of predicting the distribution of a target variable given input features using a neural network that parameterizes a Gaussian distribution.

- **Related work challenges:**
  - Existing approaches using multiple task-specific metrics: Burden of analysis due to multiple metrics
  - Cost-sensitive evaluations requiring explicit cost structure: Assumption that cost structure is known a priori
  - Weighted scoring rules in existing studies: Weighting function often has a simple form and is assumed to be provided by domain experts
  - Decision-focused learning frameworks: Align predictions with optimal downstream decisions, making evaluation alignment a byproduct.
  - Allen et al. [2, 1]: Systematizing threshold weighting and providing guidance on choosing weights for proper scoring rules.
  - Previous studies on evaluation alignment: Non-unique solutions for alignment and the difficulty in achieving perfect alignment.
  - Previous studies on probabilistic forecasting: Standard metrics do not reflect true utility in decision-making.
  - Weighted scoring rules: Emphasizing particular outcomes when evaluating probabilistic forecasts: Standard metrics may not reflect true downstream priorities.
  - Evaluating forecasts for high-impact events using transformed kernel scores: Existing methods may not adequately capture the complexities of downstream tasks.
  - Addressing the loss-metric mismatch with adaptive loss alignment: Aligning evaluation metrics with diverse downstream applications remains challenging.

### 3. Core Idea
- The model learns to predict both the mean and variance of the conditional distribution of the target variable using a neural network.

### 4. Method
- **Pipeline**: Probabilistic demand predictions using the Exponential Smoothing model from the Darts library.
- **Architecture / Loss / Training**: Alignment model architecture with hyperparameters set for 1000 epochs.
- **Complexity / Resources**: The model uses a learning rate of 10^-2 and weight decay of 10^-4.

### 5. Experiments
- **Datasets & Metrics**: Dataset consists of 168 months, with 144 months for training and 24 months for testing.
- **Baselines**: CRPS, Existing cost-sensitive evaluation methods, Existing decision-focused learning frameworks, Expert-specified weight/cost structures, Exponential Smoothing model, Interval scores, Inverse Multiquadric Score (IMS), N/A, Non-aligned evaluation, Pinball loss, Standard evaluation metrics, Standard predictive quality metrics, Threshold-weighted CRPS
- **Main Results**: Predictions made on the validation set with probabilistic demand forecasts.
- **Ablations**: Further analysis is needed to understand the impact of non-representative training samples on generalization.
- **Limitations / Stress Tests**: The model's performance can improve with more training samples and by including downstream-only variables.

### 6. Takeaways
- **Pros**: Aligns evaluation with downstream utility, Reduces burden of analyzing multiple metrics, Scalable evaluation across tasks
- **Cons**: Requires training data for the neural network, Assumes some level of model complexity, May not generalize to all types of downstream tasks
- **Future Work**: Explore further applications in different domains, Investigate robustness against various types of prediction errors, Develop methods to incorporate expert knowledge into the weighting function
