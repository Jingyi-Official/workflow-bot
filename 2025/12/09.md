<details markdown="1">
<summary>📄 Paper Summary </summary>

### 1. Task / Problem
- 3D avatar generation and video synthesis

### 2. Motivation & Gaps
- Existing methods for human keypoint inputs produce artifacts in high-frequency regions due to lack of pixel-level guidance.

### 3. Core Idea
- The proposed model leverages a 3D-aware reconstruction module to provide structural and appearance priors, guiding a distilled autoregressive video diffusion model for high-fidelity avatar rendering.

### 4. Method
- **Pipeline**: Feature-based conditioning bypasses the VAE encoder for improved efficiency.
- **Architecture / Loss / Training**: Adversarial Distribution Preservation loss (ADP) improves visualization quality.
