### 1. Task / Problem
- Scene Navigation and Goal Discovery

### 2. Motivation & Gaps
- Current avatar motion generation methods lack human-like sensors, which are crucial for realistic motion.

- **Related work challenges:**
  - Existing human motion generation systems: They typically use abstract representations for perception, lacking human-like vision.
  - Datasets with isolated human motion: They do not provide context of a scene or lack scale.
  - Reinforcement Learning methods: They face challenges in mapping visual inputs to actions while generating natural human motion.
  - Previous methods using precomputed waypoints: These methods often require manual intervention and lack realism in motion generation.
  - Reinforcement learning approaches: High-dimensional action spaces complicate reward function construction and can lead to unnatural motion.
  - Existing sensor-based methods: They often rely on oracle information or sparse sensing, lacking a realistic connection to human-like perception.
  - Text-to-motion approaches: Lack of semantic control and reliance on user input.
  - EgoGen: EgoGen requires the exact location of the goal and uses a complex reward structure to ensure realistic motion.
  - EgoGen: Limited to known goals and does not utilize egocentric vision effectively.
