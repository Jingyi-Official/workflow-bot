### 1. Task / Problem
- Scene Navigation and Goal Discovery

### 2. Motivation & Gaps
- Current avatar motion generation methods lack human-like sensors, which are crucial for realistic motion.

- **Related work challenges:**
  - Existing human motion generation systems: They typically use abstract representations for perception, lacking human-like vision.
  - Datasets with isolated human motion: They do not provide context of a scene or lack scale.
  - Reinforcement Learning methods: They face challenges in mapping visual inputs to actions while generating natural human motion.
  - Previous methods using precomputed waypoints: These methods often require manual waypoint definition and lack real-time adaptability.
  - Reinforcement learning approaches: High-dimensional action spaces complicate reward function construction and can lead to unnatural motion.
  - Existing sensor-based methods: Many rely on oracle information or sparse sensing, lacking a realistic connection to human-like perception.
  - Text-to-motion approaches: Lack of semantic control and user input requirement
  - EgoGen: EgoGen requires the exact location of the goal and uses a complex reward structure to ensure realistic motion.
  - EgoGen: Limited to known goals and does not utilize egocentric vision effectively.
  - 3D-MEM: Memory systems are not integrated into avatar navigation, limiting systematic search capabilities.

### 6. Takeaways
- **Pros**: CLOPS generates natural human motion using egocentric vision., The decoupling of motion skills and high-level control improves training efficiency., The approach generalizes well to new scenes.
- **Cons**: The method may struggle with scenes where the domain gap is significant., Training complexity increases due to the need for simultaneous learning of visual mapping and motion generation., Limited availability of suitable datasets for training.
- **Future Work**: Explore additional sensory inputs beyond vision for avatar navigation., Investigate the application of CLOPS in more complex environments., Develop methods to automatically generate scenes for training.
