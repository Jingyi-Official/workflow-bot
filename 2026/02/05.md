### [Reinforced Attention Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04884v1)


<!--break-out-of-list-->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>📄 Paper Summary </summary>

### 1. Task / Problem
- Multimodal alignment and visual understanding

### 2. Motivation & Gaps
- The paper addresses the limitations of outcome-based reinforcement learning methods that neglect the underlying cross-modal reasoning process.

### [CoWTracker: Tracking by Warping instead of Correlation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04877v1)


<!--break-out-of-list-->
<details markdown="1">
<summary>📄 Paper Summary </summary>

### 1. Task / Problem
- Point Tracking

### 2. Motivation & Gaps
- The paper addresses the challenges in point tracking by proposing a method that avoids traditional correlation-based approaches.
