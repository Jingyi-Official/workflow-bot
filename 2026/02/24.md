### 1. Task / Problem
- Dynamic Pose Estimation

### 2. Motivation & Gaps
- The paper addresses the challenge of accurately estimating the poses of a four-legged avatar using a reduced set of joints, focusing on improving the realism of the poses and the efficiency of the model.

### 3. Core Idea
- The core idea is to optimize a mesh model for dynamic pose estimation by adapting individual parameters and using a combination of loss functions to ensure realistic poses and smooth transitions over time.

### 4. Method
- **Pipeline**: The method involves initializing model parameters, optimizing them using Adam, and adapting the mesh for individual subjects based on multi-view data.
- **Architecture / Loss / Training**: The architecture employs multiple loss functions including keypoint reprojection loss, silhouette reprojection loss, pose and bone constraints, and smoothness loss to guide the optimization process.
- **Complexity / Resources**: Action tracking, label generation, and surface fitting was executed on a single NVIDIA Geforce RTX 3090 GPU. A single optimization step in surface fitting takes 0.019 s, resulting in an effective per-frame runtime of 6.65 s for our default 350-epoch setting.
